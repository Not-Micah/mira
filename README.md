# Mira - Volunteer Connection Platform

Mira is a platform designed to connect volunteers with nonprofit organizations, making it easier for both parties to find the perfect match.

## Organization Dashboard Enhancement

The organization dashboard has been redesigned to improve usability, aesthetics, and consistency with the landing page. The enhancements focus on clearly differentiating between key functional areas and providing intuitive access to applicant reviews.

### Key Enhancements:

#### 1. Clear Functional Separation

The dashboard now clearly separates two key functional areas:

- **Manage Positions**: Create, edit, and manage volunteer position listings
- **View Listings**: Browse active listings and review applicant details

#### 2. Intuitive Navigation

- Redesigned sidebar with section grouping and descriptive labels
- Added descriptive tooltips and helper text to guide users
- Visual cues to indicate active sections

#### 3. Enhanced Review Access

- Direct access to the "Review Section" via prominent buttons on position cards
- Clear indication of applicant count on each position
- Streamlined workflow for reviewing applications

#### 4. Improved UI/UX

- Consistent use of standardized class names (default-heading, default-text, etc.)
- Animation effects for smoother transitions
- Responsive design that works well on all device sizes
- Loading states with skeleton loaders

#### 5. Onboarding Experience

- Added a helpful modal for first-time users explaining the dashboard workflows
- Quick access to help information via the header button

### Components Enhanced:

- Navigation Bar
- Position Listing

### Technical Notes:

- No changes to core functionality, only UI/UX improvements
